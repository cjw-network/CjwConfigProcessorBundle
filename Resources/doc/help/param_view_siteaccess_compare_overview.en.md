## Elements:

Some elements displayed in the screenshot may vary from your view, but the overall structure,
purpose and functionality of the displayed elements will likely be the same in your version.

1. **The View-Header**:
   The View-Header is the uppermost, changing element on the page. It contains 3
   important items (from top to bottom):
   <br/>
    1. **The path**: The topmost element contains a rough overview of where you are
       in the frontend of the bundle (here: `Admin > CJW Config Processing > Parameterlist > 
       Compare Site Accesses > "admin" and "eng"`)

    2. **The headline**: It is the biggest element in the header, and it states what view
       or tab you are looking at in the bundle

    3. **Last update**: This element shows you when the displayed parameters have last been updated,
       meaning, if you updated the config, but the additions do not show up, it could be
       due to you looking at an outdated version of the page (refresh the page in that case)

2. **Site Access Parameters**:
   This is a button on the left sidebar menu. If clicked, the user will be taken to the
   parameter view for the site access specific parameters.

3. **All Parameters**:
   Another button on the left sidebar menu, which, when clicked, brings the user to a view
   of all parameters of the symfony application (without site access limitations).

4. **Favourite Parameters**:
   Is a button on the left sidebar menu, which, when clicked, takes the user to the
   view dedicated to the parameters marked as favourites by the user (this view only
   contains parameters, when the feature is enabled (check the bundle config)).

5. **Help Teaser**:
   This is a short introductory sentence, meant to provide a quick overview over what
   the current view is for. At the right end of the teaser, the `show help` - button
   resides, which, when clicked, opens this help file in an overlay.

6. **Site Access Context Selection**:
   This control panel allows the selection of the site access context in which to view the parameters. Selecting
   a site access will lead to the parameters being rendered in the corresponding context.

7. **Site Access Compare Selection**:
   This control allows the user to select a second site access. Doing so will trigger the comparison view,
   in which the site access parameters will be rendered in the contexts of both selected site accesses at the
   same time, allowing the user to compare the values the parameters hold in these contexts (refer to
   the help for the comparison view for more details).

8. **Searchbar**:
   The searchbar allows a user to search for specific keys (or values, depending on the current
   `searchmode`). Simply enter text into the search-field and wait a short moment, as
   there is a small delay between your input, and the search starting, and then you
   should start seeing the results of your search.

    1. Next to the search-field itself, there is a button on the far right within the bar,
       clicking the button, will switch the search mode from key search to value search and vice
       versa.
    2. Another button will appear, when input is entered into the searchbar: An `X`. Clicking
       this button will clear the search input and reset the search.
    3. `search-mode`: The search mode dictates how the input search text is being handled:
       If the key search is active (default mode, indicated by a blue outline around the searchbar when in focus),
       only keys are searched, which fit the given search text. If the value search is active
       (indicated by a green outline around the bar), only values will be searched which match the
       given search input.

    ```
   Example searches (in key mode):
        ezsettings          (searches for "ezsettings" across all parameters)
        ez                  (searches for "ez" across all parameters)
        ezsettings.default  (searches for "ezsettings.default" across all parameters)
        ez.default.standard (searches for "ez.default.standard" across all parameters) 
    ``` 
   
9. **Single Site Access View**:
    This button of the right sidebar will, when pressed, take the user back to the single site access
   view (a non comparison view where only the first site access has been selected). The difference to the
   left sidebar button (`2`) is, that the selected (left) site access context is kept in the new view.
   
10. **Default Comparison**:
    This button will reset the comparison view to an unlimited (and therefore the default) view.
    This is only relevant when the user first selected a limitation for the comparison (such as only
    common parameters, refer two the next to points for more information).
    
11. **Commons Comparison**:
    This button of the right sidebar will redirect to a limited comparison view. In this, only parameters
    which are common across both site access contexts will be displayed (since values in this view often start
    beginning from the second level, if there are differences from the third level onwards, these will not be
    considered when limiting to common parameters only!).
    
12. **Differences Comparison**:
    This button of the right sidebar will redirect to a limited comparison view. In this, only parameters
    which are not common across both site access contexts will be displayed (since values in this view often start
    beginning from the second level, if there are similarities from the third level onwards, these will not be
    considered when limiting to non-common parameters only!).

13. **Highlight Differences**:
    This button will not toggle a new view but instead alter the existing one: When this button is clicked, 
    the existing parameters of the view are searched for differences across the lists. Values and keys which are
    not present in both lists, will be highlighted with a `green background` and keys which have had differences
    beneath them compared to the other list (meaning there is a unique value or key present beneath), are highlighted
    with a `blue background`. All common parameters are not highlighted. **Beware: Turning the highlighting on, can 
    take some time.** You can see its effects on the screenshot at the top of the page.

14. **Synchronous Scrolling**:
    This button also only alters the existing view and in this case it checks for missing keys or values
    across both parameter lists and adds in placeholders in the other list (where the parameters are missing),
    so that the overall length and height of the lists is somewhat equal, allowing "synchronous" scrolling (meaning
    that the keys are almost always on the same height across both lists). You can see its effects on the screenshot 
    at the top of the page.

15. **List-Header**:
    The list-header may vary depending on the view, but it typically contains a headline,
    which describes the beginning of the actual parameter-list and also global utility buttons.
    
    1. On the right of it, there is the global **open subtree** button, which, when clicked,
       will open up every parameter in both lists down to the last possible level. This
       is an asynchronous process, which means that it will take time until the process is complete,
       but the first results will show up immediately.

16. Example of a **Parameter (key)**:
    The parameter list is mostly made up of parameter keys (such as this one), as the different key
    segments are split and structured hierarchical to provide a human-readable and organized structure.
    The actual visual representation is made up of various parts, such as `utility buttons` (refer to 17),
    and the key itself, but on the very left there is a visual indicator, showing whether the key has been
    opened (pointing downwards) or closed (pointing to the key).

17. **Specific Utility Buttons**:
    Contrary to the `global utility buttons` (refer to 15.1), the specific buttons appear depending on the
    status the parameter (segment / key) holds: If the parameter key sits in the hierarchy and
    does not feature values in the next level, it will only contain:

    1. The **open subtree** button: Since when the key does not feature a value as its direct child,
       there are more levels of keys beneath it and thus the user has the option to open
       up the entirety of the subtree from that point by clicking the `open subtree` button.

    Otherwise, the keys will typically feature three buttons (from left to right):

    1. The **mark as favourite** button: This button is used to mark a parameter as a favourite.
       Marking a parameter will make it available in the dedicated favourites view (if the feature is enabled).
       The button will turn yellow once clicked, indicating that the process of favouring the parameter is running
       but not completed. Then it will turn green, if the process has been successful, or it will turn back to its
       former state if the process has failed.

    2. The **copy key** button: This button will copy the full name of the parameter (including every key segment
       up to the highest level) to clipboard. `There is an equivalent function for the location info!` (see the next
       button for more info).

    3. The **location info** button: This button (spouting an `i` on its front), retrieves info about
       what file a parameter and its value are from and displays that information on the key of the request. If the
       information is requested in a site access context, the actual site access origin of the parameter and value is
       given too. The paths to the files the parameter stems from are clickable and will copy the entire path
       to the clipboard of the user, when clicked.

18. Example of a **Value**:
    This example includes the visual representation of a parameter value (colour green). As the value represents
    the lowest possible level of the hierarchical presentation of the parameters, there is no level beneath the
    value, and the value itself does not provide any additional functionality.
